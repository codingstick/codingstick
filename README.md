# Coding Stick
Coding Stick? My first stint at a software company was back in the mainframe days, coding assembler 
language onto sheets of paper using a tool made of wood and graphite, commonly called a pencil. Someone 
long ago  called it a coding stick. The name stuck.

[The Coding Stick](https://codingstick.com) is my associated blog. You can reach me at mike@codingstick.com
